## How It Works:

1. Reads the `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` file using **pandas**
2. Creates a dictionary mapping letters to NATO phonetic codes
3. Prompts the user to enter a word
4. Converts each letter of the input into its corresponding NATO code
5. Outputs the result as a list of phonetic words
